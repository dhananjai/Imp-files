Steps to run Rspec on local enviornment:

1. Edit your database.yml file to have new db name on your localhost for
development and test environment.
development:
adapter: mysql
encoding: utf8
database: dashgo_development
username: root
password:

test:
adapter: mysql
encoding: utf8
database: dashgo_test
username: root
password:

2. Go to RAILS_ROOT of application and run
rake ap:db:all (this should create 2 databases on your mysql server)
for Rails-3 application if any error occur while runnig above command run
bundle exec rake ap:db:all(this should create 2 databases on mysql server)
or run commands 
bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV= test(this should test databases on mysql server)
bundle exec rake db:create (this should create development databases on mysql server)

3. now run
rake spec (this should run all rspecs in code and will give you success
or failure results and this command is applicable in Rails -3 also)
