Here is our List of Tips for Scoring well in Technical Interviews

1.) Knowledge of programming is very important. Sometimes at your interview
you will be given a programming =93quiz=94 where you will have to answer a =
short
test on a language such as Java, for example:

   - =93What is the most basic element of a java program?=94 i.e. a class
   - =93What do RMI / JDBC / RPC stand for? What are they used for?=94
   - =93Explain what an interface is in Java, and what it is used for.=94

Revision of Computer Programming I and II modules would be perfect material
to prepare for this.

2.) You could also be asked to do a problem solving exercise where you=92ll=
 be
given a problem and you have to write out a solution on a whiteboard or on
paper and show the interview panel your answer. The key to doing this
successfully is not to panic and to make sure the panel know your logic
behind how you come to your solution.

Another recommendation would be for students to practice their problem
solving skills even in pseudo code as the other key part of an interview
could consist of a problem which required a solution to be drawn out on a
white board. This sounds like quite a daunting prospect but as long as you
talk the interviewers through what you are thinking and do not rush it all
will be good.

3.) It is important that you appear outgoing and friendly and stress
team-working skills and give a history of group projects completed at
Queen's.4.) You might also be asked general questions such as:


   - =93How do you cope with difficult workloads?=94
   - =93Name a difficult situation you've experienced and how you cope with
   it.=94
   - =93How do you resolve a difference of opinion with a superior?=94

5.) Browse throw some of the site listing Technical interview Question and
answers like http://www.techinterviews.com/ or http://www.geekinterview.com=
/

6.) Testing questions:

You have a whiteboard, and are given a question along the lines of

"You have a method that checks if a triangle is scalene. It takes as
parameters three integers representing the sizes of the sides. What inputs
would you use as tests for this method?"

So you've to write down what inputs you would try to determine if the metho=
d
worked 100% correctly, and for each state what output you would expect. So
you have to put in sizes that are valid, sizes where the triangle is
equilateral, sizes where it can not be a triangle (e.g. 5000, 1, 1),
negative integers.

7.) Programming Questions:

You could be given a matrix (2d array) of letters, and had to write on the
whiteboard, as close to java as possible, a method that would search throug=
h
that matrix for a given word.

e.g.    Search for DOG in the following

|REGGDA|
|HUDOGC|
|PQOKCX|
|GFOMPO|
|POIREJ|

So you are writing a method like findWord (char[][] letterMatrix, String
wordToFind) { ...

Another question might be to write a method that checked if a word was a
palindrome.

8.) If you don=92t know the answer to a question, don=92t try and bluff you=
r way
through it because you=92ll be caught out in the end. Admit that you don=92=
t
know or that you haven=92t covered it yet in your course, it=92s alright to=
 not
know the answer to everything.

9.) At the end of your interview it helps to ask questions and to seem
genuinely interested in working at the company. Of course, don=92t act
interested if you=92re not actually interested! There=92s no point trying t=
o get
a place in a job you won=92t enjoy and somebody else would have benefited
from. Research the company beforehand and have a list of questions you woul=
d
like answered.

   - What languages they used?
   - What IDE's they used?
   - What sort of work I should be expecting?
   - What the social life was like at the company?

All the Best to all you guys there. We hope these tips will help you in
Interview.
